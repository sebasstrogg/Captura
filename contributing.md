## Questions and Discussions - Gitter
You can always [Chat on Gitter](https://gitter.im/MathewSachin/Screna).

## Reporting Bugs - Issues
* Check the [FAQ](faq.html)
* Check if a similar issue is already reported. If so then comment on that issue with details specific to your case.
* Check if the issue is resolved on the latest commit.
* If possible, Include **steps** to replicate the problem or a sample project.

## Code - Pull Requests
1. Fork a repository you want to contribute to.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Push your changes.
4. Create Pull Request.

* Make sure to follow the **Code-Style** followed throughout Screna.
* Make use of latest C# features and ReSharper.
* Thoroughly **test** your work.

### Very Important
If you intend to make a big change, create a Pull Request early and include `(WIP)` in its title.
- So that everyone knows what you are working so that there are no redundancies.
- To know before-hand if what you intend to do goes well with the Roadmap of the project.

> You could still send a Pull Request even if you are uncomfortable with the guidelines.
We would help you to make your code comply with our guidelines.

## Stars
The simplest way to contribute is to Star the repositories.

## Test
Testing the libraries would also be a huge help.
